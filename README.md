The source code of the web application is in the `webapp` directory.

The screens directory contains the early HTML prototypes. They are meant to be
prototypes, not the real application. It is not using MVC. It does not have any
real features or database connections. Some Java code is in JSP files just for
the sake of the prototype. Those code are all removed in the real `webapp`.
