This is NOT the webapp!
-----------------------

This is only an early HTML prototype of the project. It is not using MVC.
It does not have any real features or database connections.
Some Java code is in JSP files just for the sake of the prototype.
Those code are all removed in the real `../webapp`.

For the finished final version of the webapp, please see the `../webapp/`
directory.
